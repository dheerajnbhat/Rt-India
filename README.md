## $R_{0}$
$R_{0}$, pronounced “R naught,” is a mathematical term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease is. It’s also referred to as the reproduction number. As an infection is transmitted to new people, it reproduces itself.

$R_{0}$ tells you the average number of people who will contract a contagious disease from one person with that disease. It specifically applies to a population of people who were previously free of infection and haven’t been vaccinated.

### $R_{0}$ values
Three possibilities exist for the potential transmission or decline of a disease, depending on its $R_{0}$ value:

* If $R_{0}$ is less than 1, each existing infection causes less than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out.
* If $R_{0}$ equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. The disease will stay alive and stable, but there won’t be an outbreak or an epidemic.
* If $R_{0}$ is more than 1, each existing infection causes more than one new infection. The disease will be transmitted between people, and there may be an outbreak or epidemic.
